# Installation Instructions

For now until I get the npm package configured you can manually install docdown using a combination of npm and 'cp'

## NPM Packages

Inside of the main docdown folder run the following locally so they are installed in the node_modules

npm install markdown-js
npm install optimist


## create the bin

cp bin/docdown.js /usr/local/bin
